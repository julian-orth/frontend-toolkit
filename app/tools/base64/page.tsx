            What is Base64 Encoding?
          </h2>
          <div className="space-y-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            <p>
              Base64 is a binary-to-text encoding scheme that converts binary
              data into an ASCII string format using a set of 64 printable
              characters. The name "Base64" comes from the fact that it uses 64
              different characters to represent data: uppercase letters (A-Z),
              lowercase letters (a-z), digits (0-9), plus (+), and forward slash
              (/).
            </p>
            <p>
              Originally developed for MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail
              Extensions), Base64 encoding ensures that binary data remains
              intact when transmitted across systems that are designed to handle
              only text data. This is particularly important for email systems,
              URLs, and data storage in text formats like JSON or XML.
            </p>
            <p>
              The encoding process takes every 3 bytes of binary data and
              converts them into 4 ASCII characters. This results in an
              approximately 33% increase in data size, which is the trade-off
              for ensuring compatibility across text-based systems.

                Is Base64 encoding the same as encryption?
              </summary>
              <p className="mt-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
                No, Base64 is not encryption. It's simply an encoding scheme
                that converts binary data to ASCII text. Anyone can decode
                Base64 data without needing a key or password. Base64 provides
                no security or confidentiality—it only ensures data integrity
                during transmission through text-based systems. For security,
                you need actual encryption algorithms like AES, RSA, or use it
                over secure channels like HTTPS.

                Why does Base64 encoding increase file size?
              </summary>
              <p className="mt-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
                Base64 encoding increases data size by approximately 33% (more
                precisely, 4/3 or 133% of the original size). This happens
                because Base64 converts every 3 bytes (24 bits) of data into 4
                ASCII characters. Each ASCII character uses 8 bits, so 3 bytes
                become 4 bytes. This size increase is the trade-off for making
                binary data safely transmittable as text.

                What are the padding characters (=) at the end?
              </summary>
              <p className="mt-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
                The equals sign (=) is used as padding when the input data
                length isn't divisible by 3. Since Base64 converts 3-byte groups
                into 4-character groups, padding ensures the output length is
                always a multiple of 4. One or two equals signs may appear at
                the end: one = means the last group had 2 bytes, and two ==
                means it had 1 byte. In URL-safe Base64, padding is often
                omitted as it can be inferred from the data length.

              <p className="mt-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
                Yes, Base64 can encode any type of binary file including images
                (JPEG, PNG, GIF), documents (PDF, Word), executables, or any
                other file format. However, for large files, the encoding
                process may take time and the resulting text will be
                significantly larger. Our tool works best with text data and
                smaller binary files. For very large files, consider using
                specialized tools or server-side processing.

                uses + and / which have special meaning in URLs, while Base64URL
                replaces them with - and _ respectively. Additionally, Base64URL
                typically omits the padding = characters. Both can be decoded to

                This error occurs when the input string contains invalid Base64
                characters or has incorrect formatting. Common causes include:
                using characters outside the Base64 alphabet (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, +,
                /, =), incorrect padding, or trying to decode regular text that
                isn't Base64-encoded. Make sure you're decoding actual Base64
                data. If you encoded data with URL-safe mode, decode it with
                URL-safe mode enabled as well.

                Our tool automatically handles Unicode text using UTF-8 encoding
                before converting to Base64. This means you can encode text in
                any language (Chinese, Arabic, emoji, etc.) and it will work
                correctly. When decoding, the tool expects UTF-8 encoded text.
                If you're working with other character encodings, you may need
                to convert your data to UTF-8 first. Most modern applications
                use UTF-8 by default, so this typically isn't an issue.

                This tool works in all modern browsers including Chrome,
                Firefox, Safari, Edge, and Opera. It requires JavaScript to be
                enabled and uses standard Web APIs (btoa/atob for Base64
                encoding/decoding, TextEncoder/TextDecoder for UTF-8 handling).
                These APIs have been supported in all major browsers for many
                years. The tool is also fully responsive and works on mobile
                devices, tablets, and desktop computers.

                  <strong>RFC 2045:</strong> MIME Part One, which specifies
                  Base64 for email attachments and the 76-character line length

                The Base64 alphabet consists of 64 ASCII characters selected to

                Each Base64 character represents exactly 6 bits of data. When
                encoding, the input is divided into 6-bit groups, and each group
                is mapped to its corresponding Base64 character. This is why 3
                bytes (24 bits) of input become 4 Base64 characters (4 × 6 bits
                = 24 bits).
