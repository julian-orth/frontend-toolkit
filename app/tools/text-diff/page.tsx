              What is a Text Diff Tool?

              <p>
                A text diff (difference) tool is an essential utility for
                comparing two text documents and visualizing their differences.
                Whether you're reviewing code changes, comparing document
                versions, analyzing configuration files, or resolving merge
                conflicts, a diff tool highlights exactly what has been added,
                removed, or modified between two texts. This makes it easy to
                spot changes at a glance without manually reading through both
                documents.
              </p>
              <p>
                The term "diff" comes from the Unix diff utility created in the
                early 1970s by Douglas McIlroy and James Hunt. This foundational
                tool introduced the concept of computing the minimum set of
                changes needed to transform one file into another. Modern diff
                tools, including this one, use sophisticated algorithms like the
                Myers diff algorithm (created by Eugene W. Myers in 1986) to
                efficiently compute differences even for large files.
              </p>
              <p>
                Text diff tools are ubiquitous in software development, used
                daily by millions of developers through version control systems
                like Git, code review platforms like GitHub and GitLab, and
                integrated development environments (IDEs). They're also
                valuable for writers, editors, legal professionals, and anyone
                who needs to track changes in text documents over time.

                <p className="mt-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
                  This tool uses the Myers diff algorithm (developed by Eugene
                  W. Myers in 1986), which is the industry standard for
                  computing differences between texts. It's the same algorithm
                  powering Git, Unix diff, and most modern version control
                  systems. The Myers algorithm efficiently finds the shortest
                  edit script (smallest set of changes) to transform one text
                  into another, making it both fast and accurate even for large
                  files.

                  The generated unified diff patch follows the standard format
                  used by Git and Unix patch tools. You can apply it using: "git
                  apply patch.diff" for Git repositories, "patch &lt;
                  patch.diff" for Unix patch command, or import it into version
                  control systems. The patch includes headers showing old and
                  new file names, line number ranges (@@), and all changes with
                  +/- markers, making it a portable way to share or apply
                  changes.

                  Why should I ignore whitespace when comparing code?
                </summary>
                <p className="mt-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
                  Ignoring whitespace is crucial when comparing code because
                  formatting changes (indentation, spacing, line endings) don't
                  affect functionality but can create hundreds of false
                  "changes." This is especially important when: comparing code
                  formatted by different editors or linters, reviewing changes
                  after auto- formatting, working across different operating
                  systems (Windows vs Unix line endings), or when team members
                  use different tab/space settings. Ignoring whitespace lets you
                  focus on actual code changes that matter.

                <p className="mt-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
                  Split view shows both texts side-by-side in parallel columns,
                  making it easier to see context and structure of both versions
                  simultaneously. It's better for understanding overall changes
                  and seeing how modifications affect surrounding code. Unified
                  view combines both texts into a single column with +/-
                  markers, which is more compact and matches Git's output
                  format. Use split view for detailed review and context,
                  unified view for quick scanning or when familiar with Git
                  patch format.

                  No, this tool is designed specifically for text file
                  comparison. Binary files (images, executables, compressed
                  files, PDFs) require specialized binary diff tools that work
                  with bytes rather than text characters. For images, use visual
                  diff tools that show pixel-by-pixel differences. For other
                  binary files, consider tools like vbindiff or specialized diff

                  While the tool can handle reasonably large files (several

                  crash your browser depending on your device's memory and
                  performance. For best results, keep files under 1-2MB. For
                  comparing very large files (10MB+), consider using
                  command-line tools like diff, git diff, or specialized diff
                  utilities designed for large-scale comparisons that don't run

                  Use character-by-character for precise comparison needs:
                  finding typos, comparing short strings, analyzing data values,
                  or when you need to see exactly where individual characters
                  differ. Line-by- line is best for code or structured text

                </summary>
                <p className="mt-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
                  The "ignore case" option makes the comparison
                  case-insensitive, treating uppercase and lowercase letters as
                  equivalent. For example, "Hello" and "hello" would be
                  considered identical. This is useful when comparing:
                  user-generated content where capitalization varies,
                  case-insensitive programming languages, text where
                  capitalization doesn't affect meaning, or when you want to
                  focus on content changes rather than formatting. It works with
                  word and character comparison modes but not line-by-line.

                <p>
                  <strong>Start with line-by-line view:</strong> Begin with
                  line-by-line comparison in split view to get a quick overview
                  of changes. This helps you understand the scope and type of
                  modifications before diving into details. Once you've
                  identified interesting sections, switch to word or character
                  mode for detailed analysis.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Use appropriate comparison modes:</strong> Match the
                  comparison mode to your content type. Code and configuration
                  files benefit from line-by-line with whitespace ignored.
                  Natural language documents work better with word-by-word
                  comparison. Precise string or data comparison needs
                  character-by-character mode.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Leverage view options strategically:</strong> Enable
                  "ignore whitespace" when formatting changes obscure real
                  content changes. Use "ignore case" for case-insensitive
                  comparisons. Turn on "newlines as tokens" when paragraph
                  structure changes are important. These options help you focus
                  on the changes that actually matter.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Save important diffs as patches:</strong> When you
                  need to share changes or apply them later, export to unified
                  diff patch format. This creates a portable,
                  version-control-compatible file that documents exactly what
                  changed and can be applied programmatically with Git or patch
                  tools.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Use context to understand changes:</strong> Don't just
                  look at the highlighted changes—read the surrounding unchanged
                  lines to understand why changes were made. Context helps you
                  evaluate whether changes are correct, safe, and appropriate.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Compare incrementally for large changes:</strong> When
                  reviewing major rewrites or large updates, break the
                  comparison into smaller chunks. Compare files section by
                  section or function by function to make the review process
                  more manageable and reduce the chance of missing important
                  changes.

                  The Myers algorithm finds the shortest edit script (SES)
                  between two sequences—the minimum set of insertions and
                  deletions needed to transform one text into another. It uses a
                  graph-based approach where: the x-axis represents the original
                  text, y-axis represents the modified text, and the algorithm
                  finds the shortest path through this edit graph. This
                  guarantees optimal results: the smallest possible diff that
