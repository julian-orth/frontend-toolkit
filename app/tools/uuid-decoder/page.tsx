            What is UUID Decoding?

            <p>
              UUID decoding is the process of extracting embedded information
              from a UUID string by analyzing its structure and bit layout.
              While UUIDs appear as opaque 128-bit identifiers, certain versions
              encode meaningful data that can be extracted: version 1 and
              version 7 UUIDs contain timestamps, version 1 UUIDs may include
              node identifiers (MAC addresses), and all UUIDs carry version and
              variant indicators in specific bit positions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Understanding what information is embedded in a UUID helps with
              debugging distributed systems, auditing identifier generation,
              investigating event ordering, and validating that systems are
              producing the expected UUID versions. For example, if your API is
              supposed to generate v4 random UUIDs but you discover it's
              actually generating v1 UUIDs, this could have privacy implications
              since v1 may expose machine information.
            </p>
            <p>
              This decoder analyzes the UUID structure according to RFC 4122
              specifications, extracting version numbers, variant types,
              embedded timestamps (for time-based versions), and node
              identifiers when available. It provides human-readable
              explanations of each field, making it easy to understand what data
              is encoded in any UUID.

              <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
                Every UUID encodes its version in 4 bits at a specific position
                (the M in xxxxxxxx-xxxx-Mxxx-Nxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx) and variant in
                2-3 bits (the N position). The decoder parses these bits to
                identify the UUID type. Version indicates the generation
                algorithm (1=time- based, 3=MD5 hash, 4=random, 5=SHA-1 hash,
                7=time-ordered). Variant indicates the UUID layout specification

              <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
                Version 1 UUIDs encode a 60-bit timestamp representing
                100-nanosecond intervals since October 15, 1582 (UUID epoch).
                This timestamp is split across multiple fields in the UUID
                structure. The decoder reassembles these fields, converts the
                UUID epoch timestamp to Unix epoch (January 1, 1970), and
                displays a human-readable date and time. This provides

                Version 1 UUIDs include a 48-bit node identifier in the last 12
                hex digits. Originally this was the IEEE 802 MAC address of the
                generating machine's network interface. Modern implementations
                often use random node IDs or hash-based identifiers instead of
                real MAC addresses for privacy. The decoder extracts this field
                and indicates whether it appears to be a multicast (randomized)
                or unicast (potentially real MAC) address.

                bits) are cryptographically random, providing no extractable
                metadata. This makes v4 UUIDs the most privacy-preserving

              <p className="mt-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
                It depends on the UUID version. Version 1 UUIDs contain embedded
                timestamps (100-nanosecond precision since 1582) and node
                identifiers (potentially MAC addresses). Version 7 UUIDs contain
                Unix timestamps in milliseconds. Version 3 and 5 are hashed
                values that cannot be reversed to extract original input.
                Version 4 is purely random with no extractable information. All
                versions include version and variant indicators in specific bit

                Timestamps extracted from v1 or v7 UUIDs are approximate and
                should not be used as authoritative sources of truth. Clock skew
                between machines, time zone differences, and clock adjustments
                can affect accuracy. Use decoded timestamps for debugging and
                approximate ordering, but rely on explicit timestamp fields in
                your data model for business logic and accurate time tracking.
                The precision is there, but accuracy depends on the generating

                Historically yes, but modern implementations typically use
                random node identifiers instead. RFC 4122 allows using random
                values for the node field with the multicast bit set to indicate
                it's not a real MAC address. Check the decoded node
                identifier—if the least significant bit of the first octet is 1,
                it's multicast (random). If 0, it could be a real unicast MAC
                address. Most modern UUID libraries use random node IDs for
                privacy.

                No. Version 3 and 5 UUIDs are cryptographic hashes (MD5 and

                one-way functions—you cannot extract the original namespace or

                it with the suspected namespace and name and checking if it
                matches. This makes name-based UUIDs suitable for

                older specifications (NCS, Microsoft, reserved) that used
                different bit layouts. If a UUID doesn't have RFC 4122 variant,
                it may not decode correctly or may be from a legacy system. The
                decoder identifies the variant to help validate UUID
                conformance.

                Yes, decoding happens entirely in your browser with no server
                communication. However, be cautious about what you do with
                decoded information. If you decode a v1 UUID and discover it
                contains a real MAC address, sharing that decoded data could
                expose network information. Treat decoded timestamps and node
                identifiers with the same confidentiality as the original UUIDs.

                identifiers.

                UUIDs with invalid versions (not 1, 3, 4, 5, or 7) may be:

                systems, manually created test UUIDs, or corrupted data. The
                decoder will identify these as invalid or unknown versions.
                Always validate UUID generation in your systems to ensure
                compliance with RFC 4122 specifications.

                This tool is designed for analyzing individual UUIDs. For bulk
                decoding, consider using programming libraries in your language
                of choice. Python's uuid module, JavaScript uuid libraries, or
                command-line tools can process large datasets. You could also
                write a simple script using this tool's decoding logic adapted
                to your needs for batch processing of UUID datasets.

              <p className="mt-3 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
                The clock sequence is a 14-bit counter in v1 UUIDs used to
                prevent duplicates when the system clock moves backward,
                changes, or when the node identifier changes. It's incremented
                whenever the clock appears to have gone backward relative to the
                last UUID generated. This ensures uniqueness even with clock
                adjustments. The decoded clock sequence value itself isn't
                particularly useful—it's mainly an internal mechanism for
                collision avoidance.

            Best Practices for UUID Decoding
          </h2>

              <p>
                <strong>Use decoded data for debugging only:</strong> Don't rely
                on decoded timestamps or node identifiers for business logic.
                Extracted timestamps are approximate and clock-dependent. Node
                IDs may be random or real MAC addresses. Always use explicit
                fields in your data model for authoritative information. Decode
                for troubleshooting, not as a primary data source.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Verify UUID versions in production:</strong> Regularly
                decode sample UUIDs from your production systems to ensure
                they're generating the expected versions. If you expect v4
                random UUIDs but discover v1, investigate immediately—this could
                have privacy or performance implications. Set up monitoring to
                alert on unexpected UUID version changes.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Protect privacy when sharing decoded data:</strong> Be
                cautious about sharing decoded v1 UUID information publicly.
                Node identifiers and timestamps could reveal sensitive system
                details. Redact or anonymize decoded data when sharing in public
                forums, documentation, or bug reports. Treat decoded information
                with the same confidentiality as the source UUIDs.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Understand version limitations:</strong> Know which UUID
                versions contain extractable data (v1 and v7 have timestamps, v1
                has node IDs) and which don't (v3, v4, v5 are opaque). Don't
                attempt to extract timestamps from v4 random UUIDs—there's
                nothing to extract. Check the version first to understand what
                decoding will reveal.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Validate before assuming:</strong> Don't assume all
                UUIDs in your system follow RFC 4122. Legacy systems,
                third-party integrations, or manual test data might use
                non-standard formats. Always validate variant and version before
                trusting decoded data. Invalid UUIDs should trigger alerts in
                your validation pipeline.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Document UUID generation strategies:</strong> After
                decoding UUIDs from different systems, document which versions
                are used where and why. This helps future developers understand
                identifier strategies and makes system integration smoother.
                Include UUID version requirements in API documentation and
                database schema comments.
