# Frontend Toolkit – Solo Dev Roadmap

## Context

- **Solo project:** Developed and maintained by a single person.
- **Private GitHub:** Repository is private; no public collaboration.
- **Goal:** Focus on core functionality, polish, and go-live. No team or community features for now.

## Go-Live Priorities

- Complete all planned tool implementations
- Polish UI/UX and ensure accessibility (a11y, focus states, color contrast)
- Test on all major browsers/devices
- Add and validate SEO metadata (title, description, Open Graph, Twitter Card)
- Ensure sitemap and robots.txt are correct
- Add favicon, manifest, and basic PWA support
- Write and update `README.md` (usage, deployment, architecture)
- Final self-review for bugs, performance, and accessibility
- Deploy to production (Vercel/Netlify)

## After Go-Live (Solo Maintenance)

- Add more tools (see backlog)
- Add more i18n/locales
- Add settings page (tool config, theme, etc)
- Add keyboard shortcuts
- Add tool search/filter
- Add onboarding/tour

## Stretch Goals

- Tool state sync (localStorage, IndexedDB)
- Export/import tool configs
- Community tool suggestions (if repo goes public)
- Analytics (local, opt-in, privacy-first)

## Tool Ideas / Backlog

- CSS minifier/beautifier
- HTML minifier/beautifier
- SVG optimizer
- Color palette generator
- Markdown previewer
- Unit converter
- QR code generator/reader
- Image base64 encoder/decoder
- JWT encoder
- Regex explainer

## Notes

- All code is private on GitHub (for now)
- No backend, no tracking, no cookies
- Focus on privacy, speed, and UX
- Solo project: all features and fixes are self-driven
